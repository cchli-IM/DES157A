            <p id="desc1">The labyrinth like layout of the Death Star never ceases to disorientate. While students pass by from time to time on the sidewalks, within its perimeters the only feeling conveyed by the brutalist concrete surroundings are those of isolation and grittiness.</p>

            <p id="desc2">In the lower levels of the Chemistry buidling exists hall ways from which stuents can exit their classrooms. As a transitional space, the area usually only sees activity after classes end. Standing alone in the long stretches however, one can't help but feel a foreign nagging at the back of their head. It is as if the act of staying in that space without a destination in mind is considered an intrusive act. </p>

            <p id="desc3">On Certain foggy mornings, standing at the bus stop near West Lake Plaza can be a peaceful and tranquil experience. However, such moments in time can also take on an almost dream like quality. For a brief moment, when one is alone, it is not difficult to imagine themselves as the only entity to exist.</p>

            <p id="desc4">A fog filled evening can turn even the most familiar of roads alien. What little that could be seen in the dark is further obscured by the dense veil of fog, barely penetrated by the beams of one's vehicle. The darkness that encompasses the surroundings add fuel to the mind's imagination, conjuring unsettling details that turn a mundane trip into one of uncertainty. </p>

            <p id="desc5">Within an underground parking lot, even when filled to the brim with parked vehicles, can sometimes feel off. The claustraphobic space of a contained area like a parking lot accentuates the unnatural nature of one's surroundings. </p>
