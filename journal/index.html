                  Nfinite’s website is one of the more interesting and creative designs I’ve seen in a long time. The layout of the site is very modern and minimalist, but the most intriguing part of it has to be the scrolling transitions. The site has very cool transition animations that play based on the scrolling input of the user. The animation plays only when the wheel is scrolled, and the speed as well as the movement of the animation is determined solely by this factor. Not only does this interactivity make the whole experience more engaging, but it also allows the user to comprehend the visuals at their own pace. I think interesting visuals like these aid in the intake of information, as users would be much more likely to remember something like this rather than a conventional visual aid like a corporate infographic.

                    Overlays are a fantastic design pattern that is versatile in its applications. It enables the developer and designer to provide additional details and extra breathing room in an otherwise rigid and already established space that may not allow further deviations. However, like any well meaning pattern, in the wrong hands, it can also become a frustrating nuisance to deal with and ultimately become a huge annoyance for the user to have to deal with. The most important thing for overlays is to be a helpful guide and not a road block that stops the user’s momentum. They should only appear through the user’s actions and should be easily closeable. In the end, no matter how useful an overlay is, if it is difficult to close then it becomes a nuisance. It should also follow common sense designs regarding proper user experience, such as having large and readable words and elements, as well as clear labels that allow for seamless navigation. While a polished interface is preferrable, a thoughtfully designed overlay is what truly matters.</p>

                The article introduces many key points involved in the optimization and design of online forms. Much of what was addressed in the article has direct connections to DES 112, which tackled UI and UX in web design. When I read through the article, I can’t help but recall the lessons we had on design patterns and how they all work to reduce the cognitive load of the user. As the name may suggest, cognitive load is the mental burden felt by the user when performing a task. The greater the cognitive load, the less likely the user will be motivated to continue with the task. The article takes note of this and showcases the different do’s and don’ts of form design that impact the overall user experience of the activity itself. </p>

                <p class="pspacing">I think chick-fil-a’s website encapsulates good form design. When the customer tries to order online, they are presented with a very simplistic and easy to understand interface. The user is not overwhelmed by a multitude of fields and headings demanding their attention all at once. Instead, they are separated into distinct sections and on different pages and are only able to move on and see other sections when they are done with the current. </p>
